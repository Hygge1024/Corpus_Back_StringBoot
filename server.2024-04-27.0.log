was a highly respected music teacher who began teaching yo yo to play the cello when yoyo was only four,some of the earliest pieces of music that yo you'll learn to play where bach's cello suites which are really difficult for most musicians,but yoyos father had a special technique for teaching yoyo learned to measures each day and by the end of a year he knew three of the suites by heart,but yoyo wasn't good merely because he could play difficult pieces of music,he was able to pour a lot of emotion into his playing and it wasn't long before other musician saw him as a child prodigy,in nineteen sixty one when yoyo was six he and his family moved to new York in the United States,a year later he and his sister performed in Washington DC for president Kennedy along with a crowd of five thousand people,two years after that yoyo and his sister performed in Carnegie Hall one of the world's most famous concert halls,after completing high school when he was fifteen yoyo enrolled in the Juilliard school a world renowned music school,but he soon grew frustrated with spending endless hours in a practice room and he began acting out,he rarely listened to his teachers and he avoided practicing as much as possible,yoyo eventually realized that he wanted to experience other things in life besides the cello,so he left Juilliard and without telling his parents he enrolled in Harvard university where he had a chance to learn about subjects such as history philosophy and literature,he became particularly interested in anthropology the study of other cultures,yoyos time at Harvard gave him a much broader view of the world a view he never would have acquired if he'd stayed in music school,what about the cello did yoyo still play while he was a student at Harvard,yes you're still dedicated a lot of time to his instrument performing at student functions and other events in addition he performed professionally around the world as both a soloist and a member of small groups and full symphony orchestras,then when ya yall was twenty two he recorded his first album,several more followed and in nineteen eighty three he recorded Bach unaccompanied cello suites the same suites his father had taught him when he was first learning to play,the recording was a huge hit with classical music fans and it earned yoyo a Grammy and important award in the music industry,yoyo went on to record over seventy five albums many of which were critically acclaimed,he also appeared on several television shows and played cello on some movie soundtracks,in fact his growing popularity helped to make classical music a lot more popular in the us,yoyo doesn't just play classical music though he has always been interested in other cultures and that has led him to experiment with the music of many of those cultures,in nineteen ninety three yoyo traveled to the Kalahari desert in Africa to meet with the bushman a group of hunter gatherers he had learned about while studying anthropology and college,yoyo played some classical music for the bushman and then they played some of their music for him,yo you'll learn about their musical traditions and had an opportunity to play some of their instruments,yoyo has also recorded quite a few non classical albums over the years collaborating with recording artists from many other genres including rock jazz folk bluegrass bossa Nova and tango,it sounds like yoyo really enjoys working with other musicians,he sure does that's partly because there isn't a whole lot of music for just the cello so yoyo doesn't have much choice he has to work with other people,but more importantly yo you loves to learn from others,he believed that when two people share their ideas and talents with each other both people grow and improve as a result,yoyos passion for sharing musical ideas led him to establish the silk road project in nineteen ninety eight,this nonprofit arts organization was named after the silk road the ancient trade route that connected China to the Roman empire,many cultures traded goods than ideas along this road and the mission of yoyos organization echoes this idea bringing together artists and musicians from around the world,the silk road project promotes learning and sharing among various cultures and sponsors educational programs in schools residencies for musicians and workshops,the silk road project also spawned the silk road ensemble a group of musicians from over twenty different countries,yoyo is the artistic director of the group as well as a performing member,beyond sampled tours regularly and plays in all sorts of places from large concert halls to smaller galleries,needless to say yoyo is a very busy man and maybe that can partly explain another event he is famous for one day in nineteen ninety nine yoyo was so distracted he actually left his cello behind in the trunk of a new York city taxi,the two point five million dollar jello is missing for several hours before it was finally located and returned safely just in time for his concert that night,wow good thing yoyo got his cello back after learning more about yoyo ma there's just one thing I want to do now listen to

the process of economic integration with its surrounding cities. Toronto is a mature municipality and has limited greenfield development potential.

The Greater Toronto Area has one of the most diversified economies. The largest economic sectors include aerospace, biomedical industry, food processing industry and business services.

Due to the urbanization, they have spanned across municipal boundaries. Therefore, measures are taken to allow high value added business operations to locate within the City.
